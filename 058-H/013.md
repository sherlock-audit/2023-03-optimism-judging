# Unhandled exception on l2geth node may result in panic then DoS

## Summary
A unhandled exception may occur during the notify of all the specified mining endpoints of the availability of new work to be processed, and so new blocks to be minted.

## Vulnerability Detail
As shown below, the function `notifyWork()` does spawn 'n' goroutines, each one calling `sendNotification`, which in turn does notify a miner by post request that new blocks need to be minted. In particular the loc https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/l2geth/consensus/ethash/sealer.go#L386 does not expect a miner that had received the notification and then decided to close the TCP socket without FIN-ACK tcp messages, thus resulting in a unhandled exception on `resp.Body.Close()`. The exception does occur in a goroutine and is not handled by the main go process, which will mostly result in a panic on the main go process, and so in a DoS of the l2geth node.

```go
// notifyWork notifies all the specified mining endpoints of the availability of
// new work to be processed.
func (s *remoteSealer) notifyWork() {
	work := s.currentWork
	blob, _ := json.Marshal(work)
	s.reqWG.Add(len(s.notifyURLs))
	for _, url := range s.notifyURLs {
		go s.sendNotification(s.notifyCtx, url, blob, work)
	}
}

func (s *remoteSealer) sendNotification(ctx context.Context, url string, json []byte, work [4]string) {
	defer s.reqWG.Done()

	req, err := http.NewRequest("POST", url, bytes.NewReader(json))
	if err != nil {
		s.ethash.config.Log.Warn("Can't create remote miner notification", "err", err)
		return
	}
	ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(ctx, remoteSealerTimeout)
	defer cancel()
	req = req.WithContext(ctx)
	req.Header.Set("Content-Type", "application/json")

	resp, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(req)
	if err != nil {
		s.ethash.config.Log.Warn("Failed to notify remote miner", "err", err)
	} else {
		s.ethash.config.Log.Trace("Notified remote miner", "miner", url, "hash", work[0], "target", work[2])
		resp.Body.Close()
	}
}
```

## Impact
A compromised miner could cause severe DoS on the optimism network layer L2.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The exception should be handled. An example of rightly handled exception is given by heartbeat service (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/op-node/heartbeat/service.go#L56) which is spawned as goroutine and if an exception occurs in `res.Body.Close()`, then it is handled by the op-node service at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/op-node/cmd/main.go#L144-L148
