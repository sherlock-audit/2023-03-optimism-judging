## Code Snippet
```solidity
 * @title L2StandardBridge
 * @notice The L2StandardBridge is responsible for transfering ETH and ERC20 tokens between L1 and
 *         L2. In the case that an ERC20 token is native to L2, it will be escrowed within this
 *         contract. If the ERC20 token is native to L1, it will be burnt.
 *         NOTE: this contract is not intended to support all variations of ERC20 tokens. Examples
 *         of some token types that may not be properly supported by this contract include, but are
 *@>         not limited to: tokens with transfer fees, rebasing tokens, and tokens with blocklists.
