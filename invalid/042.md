# A vulnerability allowing ownership transfer to address 0, which could result in the contract becoming inaccessible and unusable

## Summary
`transferOwnership()` function in this contract has a check to prevent the ownership transfer to the zero address, but it doesn't include a check to prevent the ownership transfer if the current owner is already set to the zero address. 

If the ownership is transferred to the zero address, it locks the contract since no one can call the  functions anymore cause of `onlyOwner` modifier to modify the state of the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L2/CrossDomainOwnable3.sol#L37-L45

Assume the following scenario,

1. The contract is initially deployed with an owner address of `0x1234`.

2. `transferOwnership` function is called with the new owner address of `0x0` and  `_isLocal` flag set to true.

3. The `require(_owner != address(0), "CrossDomainOwnable3: new owner is the zero address");`  check is passed since `_owner` is 0x0.

4.  `_transferOwnership()` function is called with the new owner address of `0x0,` which sets the owner of the contract to `0x0`.

5. `isLocal` flag is set to `true`.

6. `OwnershipTransferred `event is emitted with the new owner address of `0x0 `and  `isLocal ` flag set to `true`.

7. Any future calls to the `transferOwnership()` functions will fail since  the owner address is `0x0`


## Impact
The contract will be locked and no one can call the `transferOwnership()` anymore to modify the state of the contract.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To prevent this, `transferOwnership()` function should also include a check to prevent the ownership transfer if the current owner is the zero address.
