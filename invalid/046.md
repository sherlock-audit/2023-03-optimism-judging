# overflow427x â€“  Potential denial-of-service attack in initialize()

## Summary
`initialize()` accepts a ResourceMetering.ResourceConfig parameter without validating it.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `initialize()` accepts a` ResourceMetering.ResourceConfig` parameter, but does not perform any validation of the values. An attacker could pass in a value that causes the contract to run out of gas, resulting in a denial-of-service attack.
## Impact
Contract running out of gas resulting in DoS attack.
## Code Snippet

## Recommendation
Add a func that validates the values of ` ResourceMetering.ResourceConfig` parameters.
