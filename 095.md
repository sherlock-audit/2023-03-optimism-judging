# No whenNotPaused() modifier in the depositTransaction() function in OptimismPortal.sol

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The code comment for the "paused" public variable ([in line 80 in OptimismPortal.sol](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/9b9f78c6613c6ee53b93ca43c71bb74479f4b975/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L80)) states "Determines if cross domain messaging is paused. When set to true, deposits and withdrawals are paused. This may be removed in the future". However, the whenNotPaused() modifier, which checks for deposits and withdrawals to be paused or not, is not present in the function definition of the depositTransaction() function ([lines 426 to 432 in OptimismPortal.so](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/9b9f78c6613c6ee53b93ca43c71bb74479f4b975/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L426)l). This would result in the deposits go on even when the GUARDIAN would pause the contract.

## Impact
The GUARDIAN would be unaware of this issue, resulting in the continuation of deposits even after pausing the contract.

## Recommendation
Add whenNotPaused() modifier in the function definition of the depositTransaction() function in OptimismPortal.sol.
