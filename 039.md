# MINIMUM_GAS_LIMIT constant is still being used even after migrating the minimum gas limit calculation to a different function.

## Summary
MINIMUM_GAS_LIMIT constant is set in SystemConfig.sol even after migrating the min gas limit calculation to minimumGasLimit() function.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Minimum gas limit. This should not be lower than the maximum deposit gas resource
     *         limit in the ResourceMetering contract used by OptimismPortal, to ensure the L2
     *         block always has sufficient gas to process deposits.
     */
    uint64 public constant MINIMUM_GAS_LIMIT = 8_000_000;
```
MINIMUM_GAS_LIMIT constant should be removed from the code as it creates confusion to developers and they might also endup using the constant in the future updates, which could result in the complete failure of system resource config since we are maintaining two different values for the same operation within the code


## Impact
Medium - If used, this could lead to complete failure of system resource config since we are maintaining two different values for the same operation within the code

## Code Snippet
[SystemConfig.sol#50](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/SystemConfig.sol#L50)
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Please do remove the MINIMUM_GAS_LIMIT constant from the code to avoid confusions for the developers which could lead to high severity issues if any change by assuming the above constant is still in use.
