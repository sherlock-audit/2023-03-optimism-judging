# Causing users lose fund if a malicious user provides an accurate gas

## Summary

There is a check for the amount of gas provided in `callWithMinGas`. This check is invoked twice: One in `OptimismPortal.finalizeWithdrawalTransaction` and one in  `L1CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage`. 

If the first check is passed, and the second check is not passed, the users' withdrawal transactions are considered as finalized, but not considered as failed or successful message. So, they can not replay their withdrawal transactions.

## Vulnerability Detail

During finalizing withdrawal transaction in `OptimismPortal.sol`, before calling `_tx.target`, it is checked if enough gas is provided `gasleft() >= ((_minGas + 200) * 64) / 63`, otherwise it will be reverted.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L397
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/libraries/SafeCall.sol#L82

So far so good.

Suppose, enough gas is provided, so that check is passed during finalizing withdrawal transaction, and `finalizedWithdrawals[withdrawalHash]` will be set to `true` for this withdrawal hash. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L383

If the `_tx.target` is `L1CrossDomainMessenger`, then the function `L1CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage` will be called. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L291

It will again check there is enough gas to call the next target (like bridge or any other receiver address) during relaying the message.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L361

Here, it is not guaranteed to pass `gasleft() >= ((_minGas + 200) * 64) / 63`. If it is not passed, it will **revert**.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/libraries/SafeCall.sol#L82

But, the revert here (in `L1CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage`) is not correct. Because, the whole transaction of `relayMessage` will be reverted so it will **not** set the flag `failedMessages[versionedHash]` as `true`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L368

Since the function `relayMessage` is reverted, the low-level call in `OptimismPortal` will set `success` to `false`. Since, this return value is not handled (because of the design decisions), the transaction `OptimismPortal.finalizeWithdrawalTransaction` is executed successfully.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L397

As a result, while the transaction `OptimismPortal.finalizeWithdrawalTransaction` set the flag `finalizedWithdrawals[withdrawalHash]` as `true`, the flags `failedMessages[versionedHash]` and `successfulMessages[versionedHash]` are `false`. So, the user can not replay his message, and his fund is lost.


The question is that in the `callWithMinGas` during relaying the message in `L1CrossDomainMessenger`, the `revert` is reachable or not?

Suppose, `G` gas is provided to call `OptimismPortal.finalizeWithdrawalTransaction`.  From line 319 to line 396, let's say some gas is consumed. I call it, 'K1'. So, the `gasLeft()` when line 397 is called is equal to: `G - K1`

Suppose enough gas is provided to pass the check in `OptimismPortal`: `G - K1 >= ((_minGas + 200) * 64) / 63`
So, it is necessary to have: `G >= ((_minGas + 200) * 64) / 63 + K1`

So, the amount of gas transferred to `L1CrossDomainMessenger` will be: `(G - K1 - 51)*(63/64)`
Please note this number is based on the estimation of gas consumption explained in the comment:
>> // Because EIP-150 ensures that, a maximum of 63/64ths of the remaining gas in the call
            // frame may be passed to a subcontext, we need to ensure that the gas will not be
            // truncated to hold this function's invariant: "If a call is performed by
            // `callWithMinGas`, it must receive at least the specified minimum gas limit." In
            // addition, exactly 51 gas is consumed between the below `GAS` opcode and the `CALL`
            // opcode, so it is factored in with some extra room for error.

In the function `L1CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage`, some gas will be consumed from line 299 to line 360. For simplicity, I call this amount of gas `K2`.

So, the `gasLeft()` in line 361 will be: `(G - K1 - 51)*(63/64) - K2`

To pass the condition `gasleft() >= ((_minGas + 200) * 64) / 63` in `L1CrossDomainMessenger`, it is necessary to have:
`(G - K1 - 51)*(63/64) - K2 >= ((_minGas + 200) * 64) / 63`
So, after simplification:
`G >= [((_minGas + 200) * 64) / 63 + K2] *(64/63) + 51 + K1`

All in all:
 - To pass the gas check in `OptimismPortal`:  `G >= ((_minGas + 200) * 64) / 63 + K1`
 - To pass the gas check in `L1CrossDomainMessenger`: `G >= [((_minGas + 200) * 64) / 63 + K2] *(64/63) + 51 + K1`

If, `G` is between these two numbers (bigger than `((_minGas + 200) * 64) / 63 + K1`, and smaller than  `[((_minGas + 200) * 64) / 63 + K2] *(64/63) + 51 + K1`), it will pass the check in `OptimismPortal`, but it will revert in `L1CrossDomainMessenger`.

**So, a malicious user can provide an accurate gas (between these two numbers) to cause the users lose their fund.**



## Impact
Users will lose fund because it is set as finalized, but not set as failed. So, they can not replay it.

## Recommendation
I would say that the `callWithMinGas` should return `false` instead of `revert` when called during `L1CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage` if the condition of required gas is not met.

In other words, two different `callWithMinGas` should be called:
 - In case it is called from `OptimismPortal`, it should **revert** if enough gas is not provided.
 - In case it is called from `L1CrossDomainMessenger`, it should **return** false if enough gas is not provided.
