# Lack of access control mechanism

## Summary

`setL1BlockValues() ` function can be called by anyone who has access to the contract address. It should be restricted to only the designated `DEPOSITOR_ACCOUNT`. `require`  statement in  `setL1BlockValues()` function is a good start, but it should also be placed in the `constructor` to ensure that  `DEPOSITOR_ACCOUNT` address is properly set and cannot be changed

## Vulnerability Detail

Assume, 
1. An attacker deploys a malicious contract that calls the `setL1BlockValues` function with arbitrary values, such as below:

```solidity
contract MaliciousContract {
    address public l1BlockAddress = 0x...; // address of the L1Block contract

    function setMaliciousL1BlockValues() external {
        L1Block(l1BlockAddress).setL1BlockValues(
            99999999, // arbitrary number
            12345678, // arbitrary timestamp
            1000000000000000000, // arbitrary basefee
            bytes32(0), // arbitrary hash
            0, // arbitrary sequence number
            bytes32(0), // arbitrary batcher hash
            1000000000, // arbitrary l1 fee overhead
            1000000000 // arbitrary l1 fee scalar
        );
    }
}
```
2. The attacker obtains the address of the `L1Block` contract and sets it as the `l1BlockAddress ` variable in their malicious contract.

3. The attacker calls the `setMaliciousL1BlockValues` function on their malicious contract, which calls the `setL1BlockValues` function on the `L1Block ` contract with arbitrary values.

4. The `L1Block` contract updates its state with the arbitrary values, which can potentially cause unexpected behavior or even halt the contract.


## Impact
Attackers can manipulate the state of the contract and potentially cause unexpected behavior or even halt the contract. This can result in a loss of funds or other negative consequences for users of the contract.

Let's go over the changes made to the contract:

1. Added an onlyDepositor modifier that restricts access to the setL1BlockValues function to only the designated `DEPOSITOR_ACCOUNT` address.

2. Moved the `require` statement from the `setL1BlockValues` function to the `onlyDepositor` modifier.

3. Added an event `L1BlockValuesSet` to log the updated values.

4. Added a constructor to ensure that the `DEPOSITOR_ACCOUNT` address is not set to the zero address.

5. Added input validation to ensure that input parameters are within the expected range.

With these changes, the `L1Block` contract now has proper access control and input validation to ensure that only authorized users can perform certain actions and that input parameters are within the expected range. The contract also logs the updated values to aid in debugging and monitoring.
