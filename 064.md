# getL1GasUsed() function may not accurately calculate the gas used for a transaction

## Summary
`getL1GasUsed()` function calculates the amount of L1 gas used to do a transaction based on the size of the RLP-encoded input transaction. It does this by iterating over each byte of the input data and adding `16` to the gas used for each non-zero byte, and `4` for each zero byte. This assumes that each byte of the input data corresponds to a certain amount of gas used during transaction execution. 
But it seems to me that this may not be an accurate assumption.

## Vulnerability Detail

In reality, the amount of gas used during transaction execution depends on a variety of factors, including the complexity of the transaction, the gas cost of the operations executed during the transaction, and the current state of the EVM. Different transactions may have different gas costs, even if they have the same input data size.

In addition, `getL1GasUsed() ` function adds `68` bytes of padding to account for the fact that the input does not have a signature. This assumes that every transaction will have the same amount of padding, which may not be the case. For example, some transactions may have a larger or smaller signature than others, which would affect the amount of padding required.

Finally, `getL1GasUsed()` function adds the overhead which represents the per-transaction gas overhead of posting the transaction and state roots to L1. This assumes that the overhead is a constant value for all transactions, which may not be the case. The overhead could potentially vary based on the current state of the L1 network, the gas price of the transaction, and other factors.

All of these factors can lead to inaccuracies in the `getL1GasUsed()` function's calculation of the gas used for a transaction. As a result, the resulting L1 fee may not accurately reflect the actual gas used for the transaction, and could result in incorrect fee calculations.

## Impact
Incorrect calculation the gas used for a transaction.

## Recommendation
let `getL1GasUsed()` function to use an estimate of the actual gas cost of the transaction, rather than simply relying on the size of the input data.
