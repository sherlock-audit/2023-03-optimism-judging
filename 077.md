# Estimating gas required to relay the message on both L1 and L2 is incorrect

## Summary
Estimating gas required to relay the message on both L1 and L2 is incorrect


## Vulnerability Detail
The gas estimation for `L1CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage` and `L2CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage` doesn't take into account the line that clears the reentrancy lock for `versionedHash`
```solidity
 reentrancyLocks[versionedHash] = false;
```

This is the old code
```solidity
	if (success == true) {
		successfulMessages[versionedHash] = true;
		emit RelayedMessage(versionedHash);
	} else {
		failedMessages[versionedHash] = true;
		emit FailedRelayedMessage(versionedHash);

		// Revert in this case if the transaction was triggered by the estimation address. This
		// should only be possible during gas estimation or we have bigger problems. Reverting
		// here will make the behavior of gas estimation change such that the gas limit
		// computed will be the amount required to relay the message, even if that amount is
		// greater than the minimum gas limit specified by the user.
		if (tx.origin == Constants.ESTIMATION_ADDRESS) {
			revert("CrossDomainMessenger: failed to relay message");
		}
	}
```

And the new one is
```solidity
	if (success) {
		successfulMessages[versionedHash] = true;
		emit RelayedMessage(versionedHash);
	} else {
		failedMessages[versionedHash] = true;
		emit FailedRelayedMessage(versionedHash);

		// Revert in this case if the transaction was triggered by the estimation address. This
		// should only be possible during gas estimation or we have bigger problems. Reverting
		// here will make the behavior of gas estimation change such that the gas limit
		// computed will be the amount required to relay the message, even if that amount is
		// greater than the minimum gas limit specified by the user.
		if (tx.origin == Constants.ESTIMATION_ADDRESS) {
			revert("CrossDomainMessenger: failed to relay message");
		}
	}

	// Clear the reentrancy lock for `versionedHash`
	reentrancyLocks[versionedHash] = false;
```


As you can see in the old code, the revert is at the end to account for all Opcodes before. However, in the new code, it doesn't consider the last line `reentrancyLocks[versionedHash] = false` .

## Impact
Wrong estimation of the gas limit amount required to relay the message on both L1 and L2

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

 
Move the revert to the end, and add a check for the `success`. So it becomes as follows:

```solidity
		// Clear the reentrancy lock for `versionedHash`
		reentrancyLocks[versionedHash] = false;

		if (success == false && tx.origin == Constants.ESTIMATION_ADDRESS) {
			revert("CrossDomainMessenger: failed to relay message");
		}
```
