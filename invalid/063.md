# Risk of Integer Overflow in L1 Fee Calculation

## Summary
`getL1Fee()` function calculates the `L1` fee by multiplying the `L1` gas used by the current `L1 `base fee, then scaling the result by the fee scalar. This calculation could result in an overflow if the gas used or base fee is too large. An overflow occurs when the result of the multiplication operation is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in the variable type used to store the result.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L2/GasPriceOracle.sol#L43-L50 

We know, the maximum value for a `uint256` variable is `2^256 - 1`,

Now if the gas used is `2^256 - 1`, and the `L1` base fee is `1 wei`, 
then the result of the multiplication would be `2^256 - 1 wei`. 
This value is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in a `uint256` variable. 
As a result, an overflow would occur and the resulting `L1` fee would be incorrect.

## Impact
If an overflow occurs, it may be difficult to detect and debug the issue. The contract may continue to operate with an incorrect fee calculation, leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

## Recommendation
To add checks for potential overflow in the `getL1Fee() ` function, we can use the **SafeMath** library provided by OpenZeppelin. 
The **SafeMath** library provides functions that perform arithmetic operations with checks for potential overflow or underflow.
