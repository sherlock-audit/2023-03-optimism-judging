# Forcing edge case OOG revert in `L1CrossDomainMessenger` during finalizing withdrawals leads to user's loss of fund

## Summary

I am reporting this issue separate from my other report `Usage of **revert** in case of low gas in L1CrossDomainMessenger can result in loss of fund`, as I think they provide different attack surface and vulnerability.

In the report `Usage of **revert** in case of low gas in L1CrossDomainMessenger can result in loss of fund`, it is explained that if the forwarded gas passes the gas condition in `OptimismPortal`, but does not pass the gas condition in `L1CrossDomainMessenger`, it will result in loss of fund since the opcode `revert` (instead of `return`) is used in `L1CrossDomainMessenger`. 
https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/9b9f78c6613c6ee53b93ca43c71bb74479f4b975/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L361
https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/9b9f78c6613c6ee53b93ca43c71bb74479f4b975/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/libraries/SafeCall.sol#L82

But, in this report, I am going to explain that there are scenarios leading to out-of-gas (OOG) revert of transaction in `L1CrossDomainMessenger` without reaching to the opcode `revert`. In other words, even if opcode `return` is used instead of `revert` during checking the gas condition in `L1CrossDomainMessenger`, there is an attack possibility of forcing OOG revert in `L1CrossDomainMessenger` resulting in failure of user's withdrawal transaction without allowing them to replay. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Suppose, `G` gas is provided to call `OptimismPortal.finalizeWithdrawalTransaction`.  From line 319 to line 396, let's say some gas is consumed. I call it, `K1`. So, the `gasLeft()` when line 397 is called is equal to: `G - K1`
https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/9b9f78c6613c6ee53b93ca43c71bb74479f4b975/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L319-L396

Suppose enough gas is provided to pass the condition in `OptimismPortal`: `G - K1 >= ((_minGas + 200) * 64) / 63`
So, it is necessary to have: `G >= ((_minGas + 200) * 64) / 63 + K1`

So, the amount of gas forwarded to `L1CrossDomainMessenger` will be: `(G - K1 - 51)*(63/64)`
Please note this number is based on the estimation of gas consumption explained in the comment:
>> // Because EIP-150 ensures that, a maximum of 63/64ths of the remaining gas in the call
            // frame may be passed to a subcontext, we need to ensure that the gas will not be
            // truncated to hold this function's invariant: "If a call is performed by
            // `callWithMinGas`, it must receive at least the specified minimum gas limit." In
            // addition, exactly 51 gas is consumed between the below `GAS` opcode and the `CALL`
            // opcode, so it is factored in with some extra room for error.

In the function `L1CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage`, some gas will be consumed from line 299 to line 360. For simplicity, I call this amount of gas `K2`.
https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/9b9f78c6613c6ee53b93ca43c71bb74479f4b975/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L299-L360

So, the `gasLeft()` in line 361 will be: `(G - K1 - 51)*(63/64) - K2`

Inside the `SafeCall` if the condition `gasleft() >= ((_minGas + 200) * 64) / 63` is not satisfied, almost 74 gas is consumed from line 54 to 79 (not including the `revert` in line 82).
https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/9b9f78c6613c6ee53b93ca43c71bb74479f4b975/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/libraries/SafeCall.sol#L54-L79

The detail of each gas is:

```solidity
       bool _success; // PUSH1 = 3 gas
       assembly {
            if lt(gas(), div(mul(64, add(_minGas, 200)), 63)) { // In total 46 gas = 4*PUSH1+ADD+MUL+DIV+GAS+LT+ISZERO+PUSH2+JUMPI
                mstore(0, 0x08c379a0) // In total 9 gas = PUSH4+PUSH1+MSTORE
                mstore(32, 32) // In total 9 gas = PUSH1+DUP1+MSTORE
                mstore(88, 0x0000185361666543616c6c3a204e6f7420656e6f75676820676173) // In total 9 gas = PUSH25+PUSH1+MSTORE
                revert(28, 100)
            }
        }
```

So, if the amount of available gas is less than 74, the transaction will be reverted OOG, before reaching to the line 82. In other words if `(G - K1 - 51)*(63/64) - K2  <= 74`, the transaction in `L1CrossDomainMessenger` will be reverted OOG. Simplifying the equation: `G <= K2*(64/63) + K1 + 126` (where `126` is coming from approximate of `51 + 74 * 64 / 63`)

All in all, if the provided gas when calling the function `OptimismPortal.finalizeWithdrawalTransaction` is larger than `((_minGas + 200) * 64) / 63 + K1` (to pass the gas condition in `OptimismPortal`) but smaller than `K2*(64/63) + K1 + 126` (to revert OOG before the revert opcode in Line 82), the transaction is considered as finalized in `OptimismPortal` but not considered as failed in `L1CrossDomainMessenger`, so it will not be replayable.

To have the condition above: `((_minGas + 200) * 64) / 63 + K1 <= G <= K2*(64/63) + K1 + 126`
After simplification: `_minGas <= K2 - 76`

It means that if `_minGas <= K2 - 76`, and an attacker when calling `OptimismPortal.finalizeWithdrawalTransaction` provides some gas `G` meeting the condition  `((_minGas + 200) * 64) / 63 + K1 <= G <= K2*(64/63) + K1 + 126`, the user's transaction will have the flag `finalizedWithdrawals` as `true`, but the flag `failedMessages` and `successfulMessages` as `false`.

**Please note that even if the opcode `return` is used instead of `revert` in Line 82 in `SafeCall.sol` during relaying the message, this attack surface is still possible. Because the OOG revert happens before reaching the Line 82.**

The main reason for this issue is that the value `200` which is used as a buffer during the gas condition check, does not provide any protection. In other words, to protect against this kind of edge case, the condition `((_minGas + 200) * 64) / 63 + K1 <= G <= K2*(64/63) + K1 + 126` should be broken. I mean, if `((_minGas + 200) * 64) / 63 + K1` is **larger** than `K2*(64/63) + K1 + 126`, that condition will not be possible anymore, so it is protected (it is not possible to pass the gas check in `OptimismPortal` but forcing OOG in `L1CrossDomainMessenger`).

## Recommendation

To reach a correct value instead of `200`, I replace it with `X`. So, the condition `((_minGas + 200) * 64) / 63 + K1 > K2*(64/63) + K1 + 126` will be changed to:
`((_minGas + X) * 64) / 63 + K1 > K2*(64/63) + K1 + 126`
After simplification:
`X > K2 + 124 - _minGas`

All in all, the recommendation is that if during finalizing withdrawal, `_tx.target` is equal to address of `L1CrossDomainMessenger`, the gas condition check should be revised to:
`gasleft() >= (K2 + 124)*(64/63)`
But if `_tx.target` is equal to another addresses, the current condition works properly:
`gasleft() >= (_minGas+ 124)*(64/63)`
