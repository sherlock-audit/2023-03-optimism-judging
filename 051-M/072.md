# Proposer can provide output without _l1BlockHash which will make output to be invalid in case of l1 reorg

## Summary
Proposer can provide output without _l1BlockHash which will make output to be invalid in case of l1 reorg. This is possible because `proposeL2Output` function allows proposer to provide empty `_l1BlockHash`, but he should be confident that enough blocks has passed that l1 block is already finalized. But there is no check that some amount of blocks has passed.
## Vulnerability Detail
Proposer can provide output for l2 block using `L2OutputOracle.proposeL2Output`. He should provide `_outputRoot, _l2BlockNumber, _l1BlockHash, _l1BlockNumber` as params.
`_l1BlockHash` and `_l1BlockNumber` are needed in order to prevent reorg on l1, when proposer will submit incorrect output in case of reorg.

```solidity
        if (_l1BlockHash != bytes32(0)) {
            // This check allows the proposer to propose an output based on a given L1 block,
            // without fear that it will be reorged out.
            // It will also revert if the blockheight provided is more than 256 blocks behind the
            // chain tip (as the hash will return as zero). This does open the door to a griefing
            // attack in which the proposer's submission is censored until the block is no longer
            // retrievable, if the proposer is experiencing this attack it can simply leave out the
            // blockhash value, and delay submission until it is confident that the L1 block is
            // finalized.
            require(
                blockhash(_l1BlockNumber) == _l1BlockHash,
                "L2OutputOracle: block hash does not match the hash at the expected height"
            );
        }
```
In case if `_l1BlockHash` is not empty, then it's checked with hash of `_l1BlockNumber`.
Also it's possible that proposer doesn't provide `_l1BlockHash`. In this case comments say that such output should be provided when proposer is confident that the L1 block is finalized.
But in the code there is no any restriction when proposer can provide output without `_l1BlockHash`. So he can do that when `_l1BlockNumber` is not finalized yet and in case of reorg output will be wrong.

As result, that output should to be removed by challenger and proposer will be punished.
## Impact
Provided output can become faulty in case of l1 reorg. Proposer will be slashed, however he provided correct output.

## Recommendation
Add additional variable that don't allow to provide output without hash in case if some amount of blocks hasn't passed yet.
