# Stuck funds can not be recovered although possible loss of funds is likely especially for a custom developed messengers

## Summary
Stuck funds can not be recovered although possible loss of funds is likely especially for a custom developed messengers. 

## Vulnerability Detail
When sending messages from L2 to L1, users are supposed to call `L2CrossDomainMessenger.sendMessage`. This would trigger a message to the other messenger (i.e. L1CrossDomainMessenger). Upon finlaization, the `L1CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage` is called.
The flow basically as follows:

**Withdrawal on L2**

 ```mermaid
flowchart TD;
		subgraph L2CrossDomainMessenger
    sendMessage;
    end
		subgraph L2ToL1MessagePasser
    initiateWithdrawal;
    end
		L2CrossDomainMessenger--L1CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage.selector-->L2ToL1MessagePasser
```

**Finlaize on L1**

 ```mermaid
flowchart TD;
		subgraph OptimismPortal
proveWithdrawalTransaction --7 days-->finalizeWithdrawalTransaction;		
		end
		subgraph L1CrossDomainMessenger
relayMessage;		
		end
		OptimismPortal--This must never fail. Otherwise funds are lost-->L1CrossDomainMessenger
```

However, some protocols or bridges might develop a custom messanger. In this case, they should use **L2ToL1MessagePasser** directly. Let's assume **L1CustomMessanger** and **L2CustomMessanger** are custom messengers developed by a third party, the flow then would be as follows:

**Withdrawal on L2**

 ```mermaid
flowchart TD;
		subgraph L2CustomMessanger
    sendMessageToL1;
    end
		subgraph L2ToL1MessagePasser
    initiateWithdrawal;
    end
		L2CustomMessanger--L1CustomMessanger.relayMessageOnL1.selector-->L2ToL1MessagePasser
```

**Finlaize on L1**

 ```mermaid
flowchart TD;
		subgraph OptimismPortal
proveWithdrawalTransaction --7 days-->finalizeWithdrawalTransaction;		
		end
		subgraph L1CustomMessanger
relayMessageOnL1;		
		end
		OptimismPortal--This must never fail. Otherwise funds are lost-->L1CustomMessanger
```


As you know `L1CustomMessanger.relayMessage` must not fail under any circumstances when it is called from `OptimismPortal.finalizeWithdrawalTransaction` because `finalizeWithdrawalTransaction` is designed strictly to run only once regardless of relayMessage success or failure. Otherwise, funds will be stuck in **OptimismPortal**. 

This put the responsibility on the potocol (i.e. L1CustomMessanger developer) to develop the method `L1CustomMessanger.relayMessage` in a way that never reverts if it is called by **OptimismPortal**. However, if the issue happens (which is a possiblity) then stuck ether can not be rescued from **OptimismPortal** contract. Now the bigger the withdrawal's amount, the higher the impact. 
Although the lost funds not caused by a bug, I believe Optimism team should have a way to rescue lost ether. This could be also used as a last resort for `L1CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage` failure in case of undiscovered issue that could cause it to fail.


## Impact
- Ether could possibly be stuck in **OptimismPortal** for developed customer messengers by third parties.
- Ether can not be recovered in case of undiscovered issue that could cause  `L1CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage` to fail when it is called the first time by **OptimismPortal**

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

 This could be easily mitigated by applying the following:
 1. In `OptimismPortal.finalizeWithdrawalTransaction`, if the subcall to relayMessage fails, then track the lost value (e.g. add it to a state variable).
 2. Add a method to withdraw ether from **OptimismPortal** with the condition not allowing to withdraw more than what was lost.

This way, in case of a withdrawal fails, Optimism team can still take action and recover it. Especially if the withdrawal is big and it is for a protocol that has high TVL.
