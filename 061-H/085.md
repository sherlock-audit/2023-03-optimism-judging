# Possible loss of funds if the minimum gas limit is set too high on deposit

## Summary
if the minimum gas is set too high on deposit then `L2CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage` transaction will not be processed. Eventually, causing loss of funds for depositors. 

## Vulnerability Detail
in `L2CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage` method, `callWithMinGas` was introduced to make sure the minimum gas limit specified by the user is guaranteed.
Basically the following is checked at [Safe Call with minimum gas](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/libraries/SafeCall.sol#L64)
```solidity
gasleft() >= ((_minGas + 200) * 64) / 63
```


As there is no check for the maximum gas limit in `depositTransaction`, if the minimum gas limit provided is too high exceeding the L2 block gas limit then `L2CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage`  transaction will not be processed. Eventually, causing loss of funds since `relayMessage` is reverting if you provided gas is less.

A possible scenario:
1. A protocol initiated a deposit on L1.
2. The protocol checks for L2 block gas limit by reading `gasLimit` from **SystemConfig** contract. Let's say it's 40M.
3. The protocol set the minimum gas limit for the deposit to 40M (The protcol assumes it should work since it didn't exceed the L2 block gas limit).
4. Now according to `callWithMinGas`, the relayer has to provide gas as follows:
```solidity
gas = ((_minGas + 200) * 64) / 63
gas = ((40M + 200) * 64) / 63
gas = 2560012800 / 63
gas = 40635123
```

The gas provided already exceeded the block gas limit 40M. So it won't be processed. if the relayer provides less than that, the `L2CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage` will revert. Thus, resulting in loss of funds.

Please note that this calculation is just right before [callWithMinGas](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L361) call. We still need to count the gas used before and after it. So it even gets bigger than 40635123.


## Impact

Deposits with too high L2 gas limit can not be relayed on L2. causing loss of funds for the depositors.

## Code Snippet

- from relayMessage method
```solidity
	xDomainMsgSender = _sender;
	bool success = SafeCall.callWithMinGas(_target, _minGasLimit, _value, _message);
	xDomainMsgSender = Constants.DEFAULT_L2_SENDER;
```

- from SafeCall.callWithMinGas method
```solidity
	if lt(gas(), div(mul(64, add(_minGas, 200)), 63)) {
		// Store the "Error(string)" selector in scratch space.
		mstore(0, 0x08c379a0)
		// Store the pointer to the string length in scratch space.
		mstore(32, 32)
		// Store the string.
		//
		// SAFETY:
		// - We pad the beginning of the string with two zero bytes as well as the
		// length (24) to ensure that we override the free memory pointer at offset
		// 0x40. This is necessary because the free memory pointer is likely to
		// be greater than 1 byte when this function is called, but it is incredibly
		// unlikely that it will be greater than 3 bytes. As for the data within
		// 0x60, it is ensured that it is 0 due to 0x60 being the zero offset.
		// - It's fine to clobber the free memory pointer, we're reverting.
		mstore(88, 0x0000185361666543616c6c3a204e6f7420656e6f75676820676173)

		// Revert with 'Error("SafeCall: Not enough gas")'
		revert(28, 100)
	}

## Recommendation

On depositTransaction, check if the gaslimit is too high (e.g. gasLimit > SystemConfig.gasLimit-1M) then revert.
