# `proposeL2Output` does not push a block with timestamp equal to nextTimestamp() as described

## Summary
`proposeL2Output` does not push a block with timestamp equal to `nextTimestamp()` as described

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
inconsistency to spec

## Code Snippet

The l2Output pushes a proposal with the timestamp at the time of pushing (`block.timestamp` at the L1).

```solidity
        l2Outputs.push(
            Types.OutputProposal({
                outputRoot: _outputRoot,
                timestamp: uint128(block.timestamp),
                l2BlockNumber: uint128(_l2BlockNumber)
            })
        );
    }
```

However at the description, @notice describes as the timestamp must be equal to the `nextTimestamp()`, which is non-existent now. 

```solidity 
     * @notice Accepts an outputRoot and the timestamp of the corresponding L2 block. The timestamp
     *@>         must be equal to the current value returned by `nextTimestamp()` in order to be
     *         accepted. This function may only be called by the Proposer.
     *
     * @param _outputRoot    The L2 output of the checkpoint block.
     * @param _l2BlockNumber The L2 block number that resulted in _outputRoot.
     * @param _l1BlockHash   A block hash which must be included in the current chain.
     * @param _l1BlockNumber The block number with the specified block hash.
