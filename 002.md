# 'OptimismPortal.sol' Cannot Be Upgraded

## Summary
**'OptimismPortal.sol'** cannot be upgraded as it is missing the authorize upgrade method.
## Vulnerability Detail
The OptimismPortal.sol is expected to be upgraded as:

- Clarified with the sponsor and noted that **'OptimismPortal.sol'** should be upgradeable.
- The **'ResourceMetering.sol'** has configured the storage gaps uint256[48] private __gap for upgrading purposes.

**'OptimismPortal.sol'** inherits from **'ResourceMetering.sol'**. However, the **'ResourceMetering.sol'** forget to inherit Openzepplin's **'UUPSUpgradeable'** contract. Therefore, it is missing the authorize upgrade method, and the contract cannot be upgraded.

```solidity
abstract contract ResourceMetering is Initializable {
    /**
     * @notice Represents the various parameters that control the way in which resources are
     *         metered. Corresponds to the EIP-1559 resource metering system.
     *
     * @custom:field prevBaseFee   Base fee from the previous block(s).
     * @custom:field prevBoughtGas Amount of gas bought so far in the current block.
     * @custom:field prevBlockNum  Last block number that the base fee was updated.
     */
    struct ResourceParams {
        uint128 prevBaseFee;
        uint64 prevBoughtGas;
        uint64 prevBlockNum;

```solidity
contract OptimismPortal is Initializable, ResourceMetering, Semver {
    /**
     * @notice Represents a proven withdrawal.
     *
     * @custom:field outputRoot    Root of the L2 output this was proven against.
     * @custom:field timestamp     Timestamp at whcih the withdrawal was proven.
     * @custom:field l2OutputIndex Index of the output this was proven against.
     */
    struct ProvenWithdrawal {
        bytes32 outputRoot;
        uint128 timestamp;
        uint128 l2OutputIndex;
    }

```
## Impact
If a critical bug is discovered within the **'OptimismPortal.sol'** after launching that causes a loss of assets, the contract cannot be upgraded to fix the bugs. All assets within the contract will be lost.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to Inherit Openzepplin's **UUPSUpgradeable** contract and implement the missing authorize upgrade method.
```solidity
- abstract contract ResourceMetering is Initializable {
+ abstract contract ResourceMetering is Initializable, UUPSUpgradeable {
    /**
     * @notice Represents the various parameters that control the way in which resources are
     *         metered. Corresponds to the EIP-1559 resource metering system.
     *
     * @custom:field prevBaseFee   Base fee from the previous block(s).
     * @custom:field prevBoughtGas Amount of gas bought so far in the current block.
     * @custom:field prevBlockNum  Last block number that the base fee was updated.
     */
    struct ResourceParams {
        uint128 prevBaseFee;
        uint64 prevBoughtGas;
        uint64 prevBlockNum;
    }

+    function _authorizeUpgrade(
+        address /* newImplementation */
+    ) internal override onlyOptimismOwner {}
