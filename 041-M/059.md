# Optimism Portal uses the same speed for Pause and Unpause

## Summary

In general Pausing is a safer operation than Unpausing.

For this reason, most of the times, Pausing can be performed by a Guardian.

The guardian may be an AccessControl Contract or even an EOA, because Pausing needs to be fast, when it counts.

Unpausing on the other hand can create negative externalities (MEV, Bank Run, unfair disadvantage to last users), for this reason it is typically assigned to a slower, higher importance role, such as Governance.


## Vulnerability Detail

The issue is the symmetry in operations:
- 7 days to pause -> Too slow to react to urgent risks
- 7 days to unpause -> Acceptable if the pause was not abused

- Instant Pause -> Acceptable if the risk is critical
- Instant Unpause -> Too fast as it creates a race to exit which wrecks people

## Impact

Allowing the same account to Pause and Unpause can create negative externalities which can be avoided by separating the two roles.

The separation allows:
- Pauser to be fast, when it counts
- Unpauser to be reasoned, because it may be a delicate time

The separation of concerns also allows to remove a Malicious Pauser, avoiding any risk of abuse as well

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

-> Pause should be faster than unpause
-> Have 2 roles to avoid not being able to pause fast enough

-> Unpausing should be slower due to the privilege and MEV it brings
