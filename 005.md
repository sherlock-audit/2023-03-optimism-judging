# Usage of **revert** in case of low gas in `L1CrossDomainMessenger` can result in loss of fund

## Summary

There is a check for the amount of gas provided in `callWithMinGas`. This check is invoked twice: One in `OptimismPortal.finalizeWithdrawalTransaction` and one in  `L1CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage`. 

If the first check is passed, and the second check is not passed, the users' withdrawal transactions are considered as finalized, but not considered as failed or successful message. So, they can not replay their withdrawal transactions.

## Vulnerability Detail

During finalizing withdrawal transaction in `OptimismPortal.sol`, before calling `_tx.target`, it is checked if enough gas is provided `gasleft() >= ((_minGas + 200) * 64) / 63`, otherwise it will be reverted.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L397
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/libraries/SafeCall.sol#L82

So far so good.

Suppose, enough gas is provided, so that check is passed during finalizing withdrawal transaction, and `finalizedWithdrawals[withdrawalHash]` will be set to `true` for this withdrawal hash. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L383

If the `_tx.target` is `L1CrossDomainMessenger`, then the function `L1CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage` will be called. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L291

It will again check there is enough gas to call the next target (like bridge or any other receiver address) during relaying the message.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L361

Here, it is not guaranteed to pass `gasleft() >= ((_minGas + 200) * 64) / 63`. If it is not passed, it will **revert**.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/libraries/SafeCall.sol#L82

But, the revert here (in `L1CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage`) is not correct. Because, the whole transaction of `relayMessage` will be reverted so it will **not** set the flag `failedMessages[versionedHash]` as `true`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L368

Since the function `relayMessage` is reverted, the low-level call in `OptimismPortal` will set `success` to `false`. Since, this return value is not handled (because of the design decisions), the transaction `OptimismPortal.finalizeWithdrawalTransaction` is executed successfully.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L397

As a result, while the transaction `OptimismPortal.finalizeWithdrawalTransaction` sets the flag `finalizedWithdrawals[withdrawalHash]` as `true`, the flags `failedMessages[versionedHash]` and `successfulMessages[versionedHash]` are `false`. So, the user can not replay his message, and his fund is lost.


The question is that in the `callWithMinGas` during relaying the message in `L1CrossDomainMessenger`, the `revert` is reachable or not?

Suppose, `G` is the gas provided to call `OptimismPortal.finalizeWithdrawalTransaction`.  From line 319 to line 396, let's say some gas is consumed. I call it, `K1`. So, the `gasLeft()` when line 397 is called is equal to: `G - K1`

Suppose enough gas is provided to pass the check in `OptimismPortal`: `G - K1 >= ((_minGas + 200) * 64) / 63`
So, it is necessary to have: `G >= ((_minGas + 200) * 64) / 63 + K1`
**Please note** that `_minGas` here is equal to the base gas calculated in L2: `_minGasLimit * (1016/1000) + messageLength * 16 + 200_000` in which, `_minGasLimit` is the amount of gas set by the user to be forwarded to the final receiver on L1.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L423-L435
So, by replacing `_minGas ` with  `_minGasLimit * (1016/1000) + messageLength * 16 + 200_000`, we have:
`G >= ((_minGasLimit * (1016/1000) + messageLength * 16 + 200_000 + 200) * 64) / 63 + K1`

So, the amount of gas available to `L1CrossDomainMessenger` will be: `(G - K1 - 51)*(63/64)`
Please note this number is based on the estimation of gas consumption explained in the comment:
>> // Because EIP-150 ensures that, a maximum of 63/64ths of the remaining gas in the call
            // frame may be passed to a subcontext, we need to ensure that the gas will not be
            // truncated to hold this function's invariant: "If a call is performed by
            // `callWithMinGas`, it must receive at least the specified minimum gas limit." In
            // addition, exactly 51 gas is consumed between the below `GAS` opcode and the `CALL`
            // opcode, so it is factored in with some extra room for error.

In the function `L1CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage`, some gas will be consumed from line 299 to line 360. For simplicity, I call this amount of gas `K2 + HashingGas`. In other words, the consumed gas from line 299 to 303 as well as the consumed gas from line 326 to 360, is called `K2`, and the consumed gas from line 304 to line 325 is called `HashingGas`.
 - ConsumedGas(L299 to L303 + L326 to L360) = `K2`
 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L299-L303
 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L326-L360
 - ConsumedGas(L304 to L325) = `HashingGas`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L304-L325

So, the `gasLeft()` in line 361 will be: `(G - K1 - 51)*(63/64) - K2 - HashingGas`

To pass the condition `gasleft() >= ((_minGas + 200) * 64) / 63` in `L1CrossDomainMessenger`, it is necessary to have:
`(G - K1 - 51)*(63/64) - K2 - HashingGas >= ((_minGas + 200) * 64) / 63`
**Please note** that, `_minGas` here is equal to `_minGasLimit` which is the amount of gas set by the user to be forwarded to the final receiver on L1.
So, after simplification:
`G >= [((_minGasLimit + 200) * 64) / 63 + K2 + HashingGas] *(64/63) + 51 + K1`

All in all:
 - To pass the gas check in `OptimismPortal`:  `G >= ((_minGasLimit * (1016/1000) + messageLength * 16 + 200_000 + 200) * 64) / 63 + K1`
 - To pass the gas check in `L1CrossDomainMessenger`: `G >= [((_minGasLimit + 200) * 64) / 63 + K2 + HashingGas] *(64/63) + 51 + K1`

**If, `G` is between these two numbers (bigger than the first one, and smaller than the second one), it will pass the check in `OptimismPortal`, but it will revert in `L1CrossDomainMessenger`, as a result it is possible to attack.**

Since, K1 and K2 are almost equal to 50_000, after simplification:
 - `G >= (_minGasLimit * (1016/1000) + messageLength * 16 ) * (64 / 63) + 253_378`
 - `G >= (_minGasLimit * (64 / 63) + HashingGas) *(64/63) + 101_051`

So it is necessary to satisfy the following condition to be able to attack (in that case it is possible that the attacker provides gas amount between the higher and lower bound to execute the attack):
(_minGasLimit * (1016/1000) + messageLength * 16 ) * (64 / 63) + 253_378 < (_minGasLimit * (64 / 63) + HashingGas) *(64/63) + 101_051`
After simplification, we have:
`messageLength < (HashingGas - 150_000) / 16`

**Please note** that the `HashingGas` is a function of `messageLength`. In other words, the consumed gas from Line 304 to 325 is a function of `messageLength`. The relation, is not linear, it is exponential.**

Please consider that if the `version` is equal to zero, the hashing is done twice (one in `hashCrossDomainMessageV0`, and one in `hashCrossDomainMessageV1`):
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L307-L324

So, for version zero, the condition can be relaxed to:
`messageLength < (HashingGas * 2 - 150_000) / 16`

The calculation shows that if the `messageLength` is equal to 1 mb for version 0, the gas consumed during hashing will be around 23.5M gas (satisfying the condition above). While, if the `messageLength` is equal to 512 kb for version 0, the gas consumed during hashing will be around  7.3M gas (it will not satisfy the condition above marginally).

A short summary of calculation is:

`messageLength`= 128 kb, `HashingGas for v1`= 508_000, `HahingGas for v0`= 1_017_287, attack **not** possible
`messageLength`= 256 kb, `HashingGas for v1`= 1_290_584, `HahingGas for v0`= 2_581_168, attack **not** possible
`messageLength`= 512 kb, `HashingGas for v1`= 3_679_097, `HahingGas for v0`= 7_358_194, attack **not** possible
`messageLength`= 684 kb, `HashingGas for v1`= 5_901_416, `HahingGas for v0`= 11_802_831, attack **possible**
`messageLength`= 1024 kb, `HashingGas for v1`= 11_754_659, `HahingGas for v0`= 23_509_318, attack **possible**

It means that if for example the `messageLength` is equal to 684 kb, and the message is version 0, and for example the `_minGasLimit` is equal to 21000, an attacker can exploit the user's withdrawal transaction by providing a gas meeting the following condition:
 `(_minGasLimit * (1016/1000) + 684 * 1024 * 16 ) * (64 / 63) + 253_378 < G < (_minGasLimit * (64 / 63) + 11_802_831) *(64/63) + 101_051` 
After, replacing the numbers, the provided gas by the attacker should be: `11_659_592 < G < 12_112_900`
So, by providing almost 12M gas, it will pass the check in `OptimismPortal`, but it will revert in `L1CrossDomainMessenger`, as a result the user's transaction will not be allowed to be replayed.

Some notes:
 - Although, the attack is very expensive, please consider that in case of any EIP resulting in gas change of opcodes, the calculation of `baseGas` should be reconsidered.
 - If there is a long time between request of withdrawal transaction on L2 and finalizing withdrawal transaction on L1, it is possible that the gas price is low enough on L1, so economically reasonable for the attacker to execute it. 

In Summary:

When calculating the `baseGas` on L2, only the `minGasLimit` and `message.length` are considered, and a hardcoded overhead is also added. While, the hashing mechanism (due to memory expansion) is exponentially related to the length of the message. It means that, the amount of gas usage during relaying the message can be increased to the level that is higher than calculated value in `baseGas`. So, if the length of the message is long enough (to increase the gas significantly due to memory expansion), it provides an attack surface so that the attacker provides the amount of gas that only pass the condition in `OptimismPortal`, but does not pass the condition in `L1CrossDomainMessenger`.



## Impact
Users will lose fund because it is set as finalized, but not set as failed. So, they can not replay it.

## Recommendation
I would say that the `callWithMinGas` should return `false` instead of `revert` when called during `L1CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage` if the condition of required gas is not met.
