# Malicious actor can prevent migration by calling a non-existing function in `OVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser` and making `ReadWitnessData` return an error

## Summary

There is a mismatch between collected witness data in l2geth to the parsing of the collected data during migration.
The mismatch will return an error and halt the migration until the data will be cleaned. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Witness data is collected from L2geth using a state dumper that collects any call to `OVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser`.
The data is collected regardless of the calldata itself. Any call to `OVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser` will be collected.
The data will persist regardless of the status of the transaction.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/l2geth/core/vm/evm.go#L206-L209
```solidity
 func (evm *EVM) Call(caller ContractRef, addr common.Address, input []byte, gas uint64, value *big.Int) (ret []byte, leftOverGas uint64, err error) { 
 	if addr == dump.MessagePasserAddress { 
 		statedumper.WriteMessage(caller.Address(), input) 
 	} 
```

The data will be stored in a file in the following format:
"MSG|\<source\>|\<calldata\>"

At the start of the migration process, in order to unpack the message from the calldata, the code uses the first 4 bytes to lookup the the selector of  `passMessageToL1` from the calldata and unpack the calldata according to the ABI. 

`ReadWitnessData`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/op-chain-ops/crossdomain/witness.go#L81-L89
```solidity
	method, err := abi.MethodById(msgB[:4])
	if err != nil {
		return nil, nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to get method: %w", err)
	}

	out, err := method.Inputs.Unpack(msgB[4:])
	if err != nil {
		return nil, nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to unpack: %w", err)
	}
```

As can be seen above, the function will return an error that is bubbled up to stop the migration if:
1. The calldata first 4 bytes is not a selector of a function from the ABI of `OVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser`
2. The parameters encoded with the selectors are not unpackable (are not the parameters specified by the ABI)

A malicious actor will call any non-existing function in the address of `OVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser`.
The message will be stored in the witness data and cause an error during migration.

`ReadWitnessData` is called to parse they json witness data before any filtering is in place. 

## Impact

An arbitrary user can halt the migration process

## Recommendation

Instead of bubbling up an error, simply continue to the next message.
This shouldn't cause a problem since in the next stages of the migration there are checks to validate any missing messages from the storage.
