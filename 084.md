# DOS and griefing the sequencer by bridging large data deposits from L1 to L2 with low gas

## Summary
the fix in the `depositTransaction()` function doesn't properly fix the issue (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism-judging/issues/71). the intrinsic gas calculation for L2 message is not correct. attacker can send 4M messages by only burning 21K gas in the L1. according the protocol comment on that issue(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism-judging/issues/71#issuecomment-1452526602):
> It's a serious issue for Optimism, it could allow the creation of 4 MB deposit blocks. Although the attack is expensive for the attacker it is also costly to the sequencer to process such blocks without compensation.

after the current fix for this issue, attacker can still perform the same attack and forcing minimum 21K gas  doesn't gonna prevent attacker from performing this attack (creation of the 4 MB deposit block)

## Vulnerability Detail
This is `depositTransaction()` code:
```solidity
    function depositTransaction(
        address _to,
        uint256 _value,
        uint64 _gasLimit,
        bool _isCreation,
        bytes memory _data
    ) public payable metered(_gasLimit) {
        // Just to be safe, make sure that people specify address(0) as the target when doing
        // contract creations.
        if (_isCreation) {
            require(
                _to == address(0),
                "OptimismPortal: must send to address(0) when creating a contract"
            );
        }

        // Prevent depositing transactions that have too small of a gas limit.
        require(_gasLimit >= 21_000, "OptimismPortal: gas limit must cover instrinsic gas cost");

        // Transform the from-address to its alias if the caller is a contract.
        address from = msg.sender;
        if (msg.sender != tx.origin) {
            from = AddressAliasHelper.applyL1ToL2Alias(msg.sender);
        }

        // Compute the opaque data that will be emitted as part of the TransactionDeposited event.
        // We use opaque data so that we can update the TransactionDeposited event in the future
        // without breaking the current interface.
        bytes memory opaqueData = abi.encodePacked(
            msg.value,
            _value,
            _gasLimit,
            _isCreation,
            _data
        );

        // Emit a TransactionDeposited event so that the rollup node can derive a deposit
        // transaction for this deposit.
        emit TransactionDeposited(from, _to, DEPOSIT_VERSION, opaqueData);
    }
```
As you can see code only checks that `_gasLimit >= 21_000` and attacker can still send 4MB messages to portal (deposits from L1 to L2) and by burning only 21K gas in the portal attacker's deposits with 4MB data would be included in the L2 blocks and later published to the L1 by sequencer.
Those messages most be included in the L2 block and send to L1 by the sequencer which would cost a lot of gas for publishing L2 blocks. code doesn't calculate intrinsic gas for the deposits (21K + gas for data) properly so some of the issues explained in report https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism-judging/issues/71 doesn't fixed properly. 

## Impact
attacker can cause griefing for sequencer because sequencer need to included large data deposits in the L2 blocks while attacker doesn't burn intrinsic gas for them.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
calculate intrinsic gas for the L2 deposits in the portal correctly(based on the deposit's data) or estimate the deposits based on the data length of the deposit.
