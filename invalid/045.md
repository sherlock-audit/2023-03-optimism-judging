## Summary
In `initiateBridgeERC721()` we see `require(_remoteToken != address(0), "L2ERC721Bridge: remote token cannot be address(0)")`, but it does not prevent an attacker from using the contract's default constructor to set `_remoteToken` to `address(0)`.
## Vulnerability Detail
Despite the require statement in `initiateBridgeERC721()`, an attacker can set `_remoteToken` to `address(0)`.
## Impact
_remoteToken can be set to address(0)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Default constructor should have a check that would prevent setting `_remoteToken` to `address(0)`
