# OptimismPortal#receive() failes to make sure msg.sender is not a contract

## Summary
It is is important for OptimismPortal#receive() to make sure the caller is not a contract. Otherwise, any deposited funds will be lost due to address aliasing.


## Vulnerability Detail.

Receive() accepts value so that users can send ETH directly to this contract and have the funds be deposited to their address on L2.

However, it does not check whether msg.sender is a contract or not. When msg.sender is a contract, any deposited funds will be lost due to address aliasing.

## Impact
OptimismPortal#receive() does not check and make sure the caller is not a contract. As a reuslt, any deposited funds might be lost due to address aliasing.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check msg.sender is EOA only:


```diff
receive() external payable {
+        if(msg.sender != tx.origin) revert NotEOA();
        depositTransaction(msg.sender, msg.value, RECEIVE_DEFAULT_GAS_LIMIT, false, bytes(""));
    }


```
