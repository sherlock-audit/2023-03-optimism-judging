# Withdrawal transactions may temporarily get stuck if the output root is reproposed

## Summary

The impossibility of reproval of the withdrawals, which is a temporary freeze of user funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

The problem "impossibility of reproving the withdrawal if the output root was reproposed" ([link to the original report](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism-judging/issues/53)) was [not fixed in a fully correct way](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/4866/files#diff-db27494cd2a9e5b3dfecf8c9035186f2685e183db7ce4d3b81bfc838773914d6R196-R197).

While in case of reproposal of the `L2Output` user can reprove the withdrawal, in the scenario where some great amount of `L2Output`s should be reproposed the user will be not able to reprove its withdrawal until some `L2Output` with index equal to `provenWithdrawal.l2OutputIndex` will be published. It is so because the call of the `L2_ORACLE.getL2Output(provenWithdrawal.l2OutputIndex)` will revert in the cases when `l2Outputs.length <= provenWithdrawal.l2OutputIndex`.

### Example scenario

Suppose that the `PROPOSER` for some time proposed invalid `L2Output`s (for example indices of such `L2Output`s are `[invalidStart; invalidStart + invalidNumber)`), but users used to prove their withdrawals against such `L2Output`s (so they are not fully invalid -- they corresponds to some valid withdrawals which were proven). Due to reproposing logic the proposed `L2Output`s were deleted and a new correct one `L2Output` with the index `invalidStart` was proposed. It will be impossible to reprove all the withdrawals that were proven against `L2Output`s with indices `[invalidStart + 1; invalidStart + invalidNumber)` as long as `L2Output`s with such indices will not be proposed.

Due to the bounds on the number of possible `L2Output`s that can be proposed in some period such delay is a temporary freeze of user funds:

```solidity=
function proposeL2Output...{
    ...
    
    require(
        _l2BlockNumber == nextBlockNumber(),
        "L2OutputOracle: block number must be equal to next expected block number"
    );

    require(
        computeL2Timestamp(_l2BlockNumber) < block.timestamp,
        "L2OutputOracle: cannot propose L2 output in the future"
    );
    
    ...
}
```

## Impact

It will be impossible to reprove valid withdrawals in case some number of `L2Output`s were deleted until `L2Output`s with the same indices as used for proving will be proposed. As shown in the `Example scenario` section practically it is temporary freeze of user funds according to the described scenario.

## Recommendation

Change the mentioned check to add the possibility of reproval of withdrawal in case there is no `L2Output` with index `provenWithdrawal.l2OutputIndex`:

```solidity=
require(
    provenWithdrawal.timestamp == 0 ||
    provenWithdrawal.l2OutputIndex >= L2_ORACLE.nextOutputIndex() ||
        L2_ORACLE.getL2Output(provenWithdrawal.l2OutputIndex).outputRoot !=
        provenWithdrawal.outputRoot,
    "OptimismPortal: withdrawal hash has already been proven"
);
```
