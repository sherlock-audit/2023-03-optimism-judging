# Withdrawals initiation targeting **OptimismPortal** is allowed although finalizing it is not

## Summary
Withdrawals initiation targeting **OptimismPortal** is allowed although it is not, on `proveWithdrawalTransaction` step

## Vulnerability Detail
`OptimismPortal.proveWithdrawalTransaction` method requires that ` _tx.target != address(this)`. This ensures that no one can send messages to the **OptimismPortal** contract.
```solidity
require(
		_tx.target != address(this),
		"OptimismPortal: you cannot send messages to the portal contract"
	);
```

However, it is still allowed to initiate withdrawals on L2 targeting **OptimismPortal** since there is no validation in [`initiateWithdrawal` method](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L2/L2ToL1MessagePasser.sol#L98).


## Impact
This could possibly cause loss of funds for users who are not aware of this.


## Code Snippet


```solidity
require(
		_tx.target != address(this),
		"OptimismPortal: you cannot send messages to the portal contract"
	);
```



## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

 
 Add the same validation in `L2ToL1MessagePasser.initiateWithdrawal`, so it is not allowed to target OptimismPortal in the first place.
