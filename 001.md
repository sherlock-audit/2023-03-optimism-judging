# Any sender can cause the contract to self destruct

## Summary

Due to missing or insufficient access controls, malicious parties can self-destruct the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability is in the burn() function.

https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/9b9f78c6613c6ee53b93ca43c71bb74479f4b975/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L2/L2ToL1MessagePasser.sol#L85-L89
## Impact

Any sender can trigger execution of the SELFDESTRUCT instruction to destroy this contract account via the burn() function. 
## Code Snippet
```solidity
function burn() external {
        uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
        Burn.eth(balance);
        emit WithdrawerBalanceBurnt(balance);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider removing the self-destruct functionality unless it is absolutely required. If there is a valid use-case, it is recommended to implement a multisig scheme so that multiple parties must approve the self-destruct action.
