## Summary



## Vulnerability Detail

When depositing transaction by calling `depositTransaction` in `OptimismPortal.sol`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L426

If the `_value` is **two times** larger than `msg.value`, the **Etherscan** will show that `_value` is successfully transferred to the recipient address, while the actual transferred value is equal to `msg.value`, which is equal to half of `_value`.

Since, infrastructure like Etherscan is the source of truth for most users, this inconsistency provides a serious attack opportunity:

Let's say, UserA (a malicious user) with address `0xDE1DEd8aC7B83df26662f4E48A9e404aB6595Ba4` is supposed to transfer 0.008 Ether to UserB (an honest user) with address `0x74bcFbABC506b83715a738C0809b3Dd60A002D29`. 

UserA calls the function `depositTransaction` with the following parameters along with 0.004 Ether to this payable function:
 - `_to`: `0x74bcFbABC506b83715a738C0809b3Dd60A002D29`
 - `_value`: 8000000000000000 (equal to 0.008 Ether) (please note that 0.004 Ether is transferred along with the call)
 - `_gasLimit`: 21000
 - `isCreation`: false
 - `_data`: 0x

Actually, it is supposed that on L1 side, this transaction will be failed, but since there is no check to enforce the equality of `_value` and `msg.value`, the transaction will be executed on L1.

On the L2 side, it is supposed that the transaction will be failed. But, Etherscan shows that 0.008 Ether is transferred, while in reality the balance of the receiver is increased by 0.004 Ether.
