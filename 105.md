# Incorrect validation checks will allow data corruption in derivation pipeline

## Summary

The derivation pipeline contains a bug, which would allow malformed receipts to contaminate the stored system configuration.

## Vulnerability Detail

When new blocks are handled by the rollup derivation pipeline, system config updates (batcher address, gas limit etc.) are handled by `ProcessSystemConfigUpdateLogEvent`. The code has changed since the last contest.

Previously, all validations were done before updating the system configuration:
```go
case SystemConfigUpdateBatcher:
	if len(ev.Data) != 32*3 {
		return fmt.Errorf("expected 32*3 bytes in batcher hash update, but got %d bytes", len(ev.Data))
	}
	if x := common.BytesToHash(ev.Data[:32]); x != (common.Hash{31: 32}) {
		return fmt.Errorf("expected offset to point to length location, but got %s", x)
	}
	if x := common.BytesToHash(ev.Data[32:64]); x != (common.Hash{31: 32}) {
		return fmt.Errorf("expected length of 1 bytes32, but got %s", x)
	}
	if !bytes.Equal(ev.Data[64:64+12], make([]byte, 12)) {
		return fmt.Errorf("expected version 0 batcher hash with zero padding, but got %x", ev.Data)
	}
	destSysCfg.BatcherAddr.SetBytes(ev.Data[64+12:])
	return nil
```

Whereas now, the input could be malformed and the system configuration would be corrupted, as the important check is done after re-writing the pointed to structure.

```go
case SystemConfigUpdateBatcher:
	// Read the pointer, it should always equal 32.
	if word := readWord(); word != oneWordUint {
		return fmt.Errorf("expected offset to point to length location, but got %s", word)
	}
	// Read the length, it should also always equal 32.
	if word := readWord(); word != oneWordUint {
		return fmt.Errorf("expected length to be 32 bytes, but got %s", word)
	}
	// Indexing `word` directly is always safe here, it is guaranteed to be 32 bytes in length.
	// Check that the batcher address is correctly zero-padded.
	word := readWord()
	if !bytes.Equal(word[:12], addressPadding) {
		return fmt.Errorf("expected version 0 batcher hash with zero padding, but got %x", word)
	}
	destSysCfg.BatcherAddr.SetBytes(word[12:])
	if countReadBytes != 32*3 {
		return NewCriticalError(fmt.Errorf("expected 32*3 bytes in batcher hash update, but got %d bytes", len(ev.Data)))
	}
	return nil
```

Note that `readWord` will not raise any errors and simply return the previous `b` buffer when any error occurs, such as EOF.
```go
// Helper function to read a word from the log data reader
readWord := func() (b [32]byte) {
	if _, err := reader.Read(b[:]); err != nil {
		// If there is an error reading the next 32 bytes from the reader, return an empty
		// 32 byte array. We always check that the number of bytes read (`countReadBytes`)
		// is equal to the expected amount at the end of each switch case.
		return b
	}
	countReadBytes += 32
	return b
}
```

It means that if a Batcher address update block receipt says [32], for example, it would get accepted. Whereas a valid receipt would say [32,32, <batcher_address>]. It introduces risks from trusted receipts being malformed but accepted.

Note that the `CriticalError` that is raised by the code will not remedy the issue, as the system configuration stored is already corrupted and will be used in the next block derived.


## Impact

Data corruption of critical system parameters like batcher address could occur, when incoming receipts are malformed.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Only apply changes to the pointed to struct after all validations are passed.
