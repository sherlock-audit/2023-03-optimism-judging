# Logical error in relayMessage() leads to no revert for Constants.ESTIMATION_ADDRESS when the call to SafeCall.callWithMinGas is successful.

## Summary
Logical error in ``relayMessage()`` leads to no revert for Constants.ESTIMATION_ADDRESS when the call to ``SafeCall.callWithMinGas`` is successful.

## Vulnerability Detail

``relayMessage()`` relays a message that was sent by the other CrossDomainMessenger contract.

[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/9b9f78c6613c6ee53b93ca43c71bb74479f4b975/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L291-L348]

When the function is initiated by Constants.ESTIMATION_ADDRESS, the function is supposed to revert. However, the following logic shows that the function only reverts when ``success == false``. That is, if ``success == true``, then even the function is initiated by Constants.ESTIMATION_ADDRESS, it won't revert. 

The function should revert when it is initiated by Constants.ESTIMATION_ADDRESS, regardless if the low level call succeed or not.

```javascript
 if (success) {
            successfulMessages[versionedHash] = true;
            emit RelayedMessage(versionedHash);
        } else {
            failedMessages[versionedHash] = true;
            emit FailedRelayedMessage(versionedHash);

            // Revert in this case if the transaction was triggered by the estimation address. This
            // should only be possible during gas estimation or we have bigger problems. Reverting
            // here will make the behavior of gas estimation change such that the gas limit
            // computed will be the amount required to relay the message, even if that amount is
            // greater than the minimum gas limit specified by the user.
            if (tx.origin == Constants.ESTIMATION_ADDRESS) {
                revert("CrossDomainMessenger: failed to relay message");
            }
        }
```

## Impact
Logical error in relayMessage() leads to no revert for Constants.ESTIMATION_ADDRESS when the call to SafeCall.callWithMinGas is successful. As a result, the function might succeed and change the state even when it is initiated by Constants.ESTIMATION_ADDRESS  for the purpose of estimate gas usage only.

## Recommendation
Change it so that the function will always revert when it is initiated by Constants.ESTIMATION_ADDRESS.
