# Double counting `RECEIVE_DEFAULT_GAS_LIMIT` when directly transferring ETH to the bridge

## Summary

When transferring ETH directly to `L1StandardBridge` or `L2StandardBridge`, the `RECEIVE_DEFAULT_GAS_LIMIT` is assigned two time as the gas limit. This will lead to extra, unwanted gas payment for the users.

## Vulnerability Detail

When depositing ETH into the sender's account on L2, the function `depositETH` is called.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/L1StandardBridge.sol#L119

The flow is as follows:
`L1StandardBridge.depositETH` >> `L1StandardBridge._initiateETHDeposit` >> `L1StandardBridge._initiateBridgeETH` >> `L1CrossDomainMessenger.sendMessage` 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L247

Inside this function, the internal function `_sendMessage` is called with `baseGas(_message, _minGasLimit)` as parameter `_gasLimit`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L258
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L45

The function `baseGas` calculates the amount of gas required to guarantee that a given message will be received on the other chain without running out of gas.
```solidity
function baseGas(bytes calldata _message, uint32 _minGasLimit) public pure returns (uint64) {
        // We peform the following math on uint64s to avoid overflow errors. Multiplying the
        // by MIN_GAS_DYNAMIC_OVERHEAD_NUMERATOR would otherwise limit the _minGasLimit to
        // type(uint32).max / MIN_GAS_DYNAMIC_OVERHEAD_NUMERATOR ~= 4.2m.
        return
            // Dynamic overhead
            ((uint64(_minGasLimit) * MIN_GAS_DYNAMIC_OVERHEAD_NUMERATOR) /
                MIN_GAS_DYNAMIC_OVERHEAD_DENOMINATOR) +
            // Calldata overhead
            (uint64(_message.length) * MIN_GAS_CALLDATA_OVERHEAD) +
            // Constant overhead
            MIN_GAS_CONSTANT_OVERHEAD;
    }
```

As you see, the required gas is computed as: `_minGasLimit * (1016 / 1000) + messageLength * 16 + 200_000`.

But, if an user transfers ETH directly to `L1StandardBridge`, the function `receive` will be executed.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/L1StandardBridge.sol#L106

The problem is that the constant value `RECEIVE_DEFAULT_GAS_LIMIT = 200_000` will be sent as the `_minGasLimit`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/StandardBridge.sol#L26

The flow is as follows:
`L1StandardBridge.receive` >> `L1StandardBridge._initiateETHDeposit` >> `L1StandardBridge._initiateBridgeETH` >> `L1CrossDomainMessenger.sendMessage` 

When the function `baseGas` calculates the amount of gas required to guarantee that a given message will be received on the other chain without running out of gas, the result will be:
`200_000* (1016 / 1000) + 0 * 16 + 200_000`

In summary:
 - When the function `depositETH` is called, the `_minGasLimit` is set to: `_minGasLimit * (1016 / 1000) + messageLength * 16 + 200_000`
 - When the function `receive` is called, the `_minGasLimit` is set to: `200_000* (1016 / 1000) + 0 * 16 + 200_000`

The problem is that in the second condition, the `RECEIVE_DEFAULT_GAS_LIMIT` is included two times. While, only 200_000 is enough to finalize the bridge:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/StandardBridge.sol#L294-L310

In other words, if an user calls `depositETH` with following parameter, it will be cheaper (divided by two) than directly transferring ETH to the `L1StandardBridge`. Through `depositETH`, `_minGasLimit ` is set to `200_000`, but through `receive`, `_minGasLimit ` is set to `200_000 * (2016/1000)`
 - `_minGasLimit`: 0
 - `_extraData`: bytes("")

The same issue is available when sending ETH from L2 to L1:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L2/L2StandardBridge.sol#L74-L83

All in all, the problem is that during direct transfer of ETH, the `RECEIVE_DEFAULT_GAS_LIMIT` is double counted.

## Impact
The user has to pay more for the gas.
## Code Snippet

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to remove `RECEIVE_DEFAULT_GAS_LIMIT` from the parameter when directly transferring ETH.
```solidity
receive() external payable override onlyEOA {
        _initiateETHDeposit(msg.sender, msg.sender, 0, bytes(""));
    }
```
