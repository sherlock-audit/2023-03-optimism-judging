# Gas limit attack in the function `_initiateETHDeposit()`

## Summary
Gas limit attacks are a well-known vulnerability in Ethereum smart contracts. These attacks involve an attacker setting an unreasonably high gas limit for a transaction, causing the transaction to fail due to running out of gas. This can be used to disrupt the normal operation of a contract or to cause financial harm to its users. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Consider the function below that is used to initiate ETH deposit and informs the L2 gateway about the deposit
* https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/9b9f78c6613c6ee53b93ca43c71bb74479f4b975/packages/contracts/contracts/L1/messaging/L1StandardBridge.sol#L108-#L131

```solidity
function _initiateETHDeposit(
    address _from,
    address _to,
    uint32 _l2Gas,
    bytes memory _data
) internal {
    bytes memory message = abi.encodeWithSelector(
        IL2ERC20Bridge.finalizeDeposit.selector,
        address(0),
        Lib_PredeployAddresses.OVM_ETH,
        _from,
        _to,
        msg.value,
        _data
    );

    sendCrossDomainMessage(l2TokenBridge, _l2Gas, message);

    emit ETHDepositInitiated(_from, _to, msg.value, _data);
}
```
In the function above the ` _l2Gas` parameter is used to set the gas limit for the L2 transaction, but there is no validation to ensure that this value is reasonable. An attacker can specify an unreasonably high gas limit, causing the L1 transaction to run out of gas and revert. However, the function itself is not vulnerable as it is an `internal` function but since it is called by external functions such as ` depositETHTo`, `depositeETH` and `recieve()` an attacker could specify a high gas price causing the transaction to revert.

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability can be severe. An attacker can perform a denial-of-service (DoS) attack by consuming all the gas of the executing transaction and disallows other callers of the function execute the function.

## Tool used
* VS Code
* Manual review

## Recommendation
To prevent gas limit attacks, the gas limit should be carefully chosen based on the expected gas cost of the L2 transaction and the current gas price. The gas limit can be estimated using tools like Gas Station Network or gas-price oracles. We can add a simple check to ensure that the gas limit is not unreasonably high like the example below:

```solidity
uint256 gasLimit = block.gaslimit - gasleft() - 100000; // Set maximum gas limit
require(_l2Gas <= gasLimit, "Gas limit too high"); // Check if provided gas limit is reasonable

```
