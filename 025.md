# L2ToL1MessagePasser#receive()  lack the onlyEOA modifer, leading to possible loss of funds.

## Summary
L2ToL1MessagePasser#receive()  lacks the onlyEOA modifer. As a result, it might be called by a contract. ETH might get lost due to address aliasing of the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
L2ToL1MessagePasser#receive() allows a user to withdraw ETH from L2 to L1 by sending ETH directly to the ``L2ToLaMessagePasser `` contract. 

[https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/9b9f78c6613c6ee53b93ca43c71bb74479f4b975/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L2/L2ToL1MessagePasser.sol#L75-L77](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/9b9f78c6613c6ee53b93ca43c71bb74479f4b975/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L2/L2ToL1MessagePasser.sol#L75-L77)

However, this functionality should be allowed only for EOA. If a contract sends ETH to the contract directly, then the funds might get lost due to address aliasing of the contract. 

## Impact
When a contract sends ETH directly to L2ToL1MessagePasser#receive(), it might get lost (loss of funds) due to address aliasing.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a onlyEOA modifier:

```diff

-  receive() external payable {
+ receive() external payable onlyEOA {
        initiateWithdrawal(msg.sender, RECEIVE_DEFAULT_GAS_LIMIT, bytes(""));
    }

 modifier onlyEOA() {
        require(
            !Address.isContract(msg.sender),
            "StandardBridge: function can only be called from an EOA"
        );
        _;
    }
```
