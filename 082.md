# L2 block gas limit can be set too high which has critical impact

## Summary
L2 block gas limit can be set too high which has impact on op-nodes network and could possibly cause a consensus failure

## Vulnerability Detail
`setGasLimit` method is used to update the L2 gas limit. This can be done only by the owner (i.e. System Config Owner). The method doesn't allow setting the gas limit too low.
```solidity
	require(_gasLimit >= minimumGasLimit(), "SystemConfig: gas limit too low");
```

However, it does allow to set the gas limit too high which should be disallowed. This is very important to ensure that blocks canâ€™t be arbitrarily large. If blocks could be arbitrarily large, then less performant op-nodes would gradually stop being able to keep up with the network. This is even more critical for the sequencers since currently there is only one sequencer.

## Impact
- Less performant op-nodes would gradually stop being able to keep up with the network resulting in a possible consensus failure between the sequencer and verifiers.
- The network is not robust enough and could possibly be slow.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a check for a maximum value of L2 block gas limit to be set. For example, 30M.
