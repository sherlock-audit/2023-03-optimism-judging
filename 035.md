# Funds Donated or Locked In Optimism Portal Can Never be Recovered or Withdrawn

## Summary
The funds donated to or locked in the OptimismPortal can never be recovered or withdrawn.
## Vulnerability Detail
One of the quirks of the **OptimismPortal** is that there is no replaying of transactions. If a transaction fails, it will simply fail, and all ETH associated with it will remain in the **OptimismPortal** contract. Users have been warned of this and understand the risks, so Optimism takes no responsibility for user error. However, the ETH received from the **donateETH()** function can never be withdrawn or recovered as there is no function to withdraw the ETH by anyone or even the protocol. 
```solidity
    function donateETH() external payable {
        // Intentionally empty.
    }
```
## Impact
Funds locked forever/ loss of funds
