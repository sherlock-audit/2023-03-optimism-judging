# spec: Portal still accepts deposit even when paused.

## Summary
Portal still accepts deposit even when paused

## Vulnerability Detail
Portal still accepts deposit even when paused

## Impact
inconsistency to spec

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Determines if cross domain messaging is paused. When set to true,

However, deposit can still be made even the portal is paused.

```solidity
    function depositTransaction(
        address _to,
        uint256 _value,
        uint64 _gasLimit,
        bool _isCreation,
        bytes memory _data
    ) public payable metered(_gasLimit) {
