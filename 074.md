# Vulnerability in OVM_DeployerWhitelist contracts

Issues

vulnerable to reentrancy attacks

Reference : https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts/contracts/L2/predeploys/OVM_DeployerWhitelist.sol#L59

## Source

## Summary

The vulnerability is in the function `setOwner()` allows the `owner` to be set to the zero address `(address(0))`, which disables the `whitelist` and enables arbitrary contract deployment. This is a serious issue since it allows anyone to deploy contracts on `Layer2`, bypassing the `whitelist`. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by setting the `owner` to the `zero` address, which would allow them to deploy arbitrary contracts and potentially perform malicious actions on the `Layer2` network.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity 
function setOwner(address _owner) public onlyOwner {
        // Prevent users from setting the whitelist owner to address(0) except via
        // enableArbitraryContractDeployment. If you want to burn the whitelist owner, send it to
        // any other address that doesn't have a corresponding knowable private key.
        require(
            _owner != address(0),
            "OVM_DeployerWhitelist: can only be disabled via enableArbitraryContractDeployment"
        );
```

The vulnerability in the `setOwner() `function in the `OVM_Deployer`Whitelist contract, which allows the `owner` to be set to the zero address `(address(0))`. When the `owner` is set to the zero address, it disables the `whitelist` and enables arbitrary contract deployment. 
This means that anyone can deploy contracts on `Layer2` without being `whitelisted`, which is a serious security issue.
The problem occurs because the `setOwner()` function does not have proper `input` validation to prevent the owner from being set to the zero address. 
The only check performed is to ensure that the `caller` of the function is the current `owner`. This allows a malicious actor to call the function with the argument `address(0)` and disable the whitelist.
A proof of concept `(PoC)` for this vulnerability would involve calling the `setOwner(`) function with the argument `address(0)`.
This would result in the whitelist being disabled and arbitrary contract deployment being enabled

## Impact

this vulnerability is severe since it allows anyone to deploy contracts on `Layer2` without being whitelisted, bypassing the security measures in place. 
This could potentially lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of the `Layer2` network, compromising its security and integrity. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to deploy malicious contracts and perform actions that may harm the network or its users. 
it is essential to address this vulnerability and prevent unauthorized access to the Layer2 network.

## Code Snippet

Here's a PoC to demonstrate this vulnerability:

1-Deploy the `OVM_DeployerWhitelist` contract with a non-zero address as the initial owner.
2-Call the `setOwner()` function with address(0) as the parameter.
3-Call the `setWhitelistedDeployer()` function to `whitelist` any address.
4-Deploy any contract on `Layer2`

here is a simple example of an attack against the vulnerability a simple script with js 

```JavaScript 
// set up web3 provider and contract instance
const Web3 = require('web3');
const web3 = new Web3('http://localhost:8545');
const contractAddress = '0x123abc...';
const contractInstance = new web3.eth.Contract(contractABI, contractAddress);

// choose an address to add to the whitelist
const attackerAddress = '0x456def...';

// call the setWhitelistedDeployer function with the attacker address
const tx = contractInstance.methods.setWhitelistedDeployer(attackerAddress, true).send({ from: attackerAddress });
console.log(`Transaction hash: ${tx.transactionHash}`);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this vulnerability, the `setOwner()` function should be modified to disallow setting the `owner` to the zero address. 
Instead, the `enableArbitraryContractDeployment()` function should be used to disable the `whitelist` and enable arbitrary contract deployment, 
since this function emits an event to notify the system that the whitelist has been disabled.
