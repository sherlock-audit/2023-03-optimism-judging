## Summary

Due to missing or insufficient access controls, malicious parties can self-destruct the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
L2ToL1MessagePasser.burn();
```
## Impact
Any sender can trigger execution of the SELFDESTRUCT instruction to destroy this contract account via the burn() function.

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Consider removing the self-destruct functionality unless it is absolutely required. If there is a valid use-case, it is recommended to implement a multisig scheme so that multiple parties must approve the self-destruct action.
